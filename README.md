# Phones ASP.NET App

An ASP.NET MVC App made for a technical interview. 

Below you can find the technical specification originally sent to me.

----------------------------------------------------

Create a Web Application with MVC (Razor) that includes Dev Express components:

* CRUD for a Phone directory

* Use the MVCxGridView grid. [https://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxGridViewDemos/MasterDetail/MasterDetail](https://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxGridViewDemos/MasterDetail/MasterDetail)

* Screens:

  * List of People

  * Edit People
  
* Fields: Name, Birthday, Photograph

* A person can have N telephone numbers

* Control validations and field errors in the application capture fields.
